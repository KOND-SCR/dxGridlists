<h1 align="center">dxGridlists</h1>

<p align="center">You can view a demo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkOHHcvgbC0&feature=youtu.be">this</a> youtube video.</p>

This framework allows you to make gridlists with dxs, The gridlists works like the default CEGUI system so you won't have a lot of work to adapt your code for this framework.

Note that the core is writed in the OOP format (using metatables, not the MTA default system) so you have to write your scripts in this format too, The self for all functions should be **the gridlist which you want to perform an action** and not something else.

You're free to fork, edit and use this as you want, but sell it or remove the author's name isn't permitted, Also pull requests to improve the code are welcome :)

Fell free to contact me at the [MTA Forums](https://forum.mtasa.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=75058) if you have any questions or something else.

<h2 align="center">How to use</h2>

To use this you have to download and include the main file within your project folder and add it to the meta.xml file, After this you can use all the functions that are listed in the [documentation page](https://github.com/t3wz/dxGridlists/wiki).
